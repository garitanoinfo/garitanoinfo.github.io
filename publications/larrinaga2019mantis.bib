    abstract = { This article presents the implementation of a reference architecture for cyber-physical systems to support condition-based maintenance of industrial assets. It also focuses on describing the data analysis approach to manage predictive maintenance of clutch-brake assets fleet over the previously defined MANTIS reference architecture. Proposals for both the architecture and data analysis implementation support working on Big Data scenarios, due to the usage of related technologies, such as Hadoop Distributed File System, Kafka or Apache Spark. The techniques are (1) root cause analysis powered by attribute-oriented induction clustering and (2) remaining useful life powered by time series forecasting. The work has been conducted in a real use case within the H2020 European project MANTIS. }
