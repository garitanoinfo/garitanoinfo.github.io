abstract="The security of critical infrastructures is decreasing due to the apparition of new cyber threats against Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The evolution they have experienced; the use of standard hardware and software components or the increase of interconnected devices in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency, have contributed to this. This work reviews the research effort done towards the development of anomaly detection for these specific systems. SCADA systems have a number of peculiarities that make anomaly detection perform better than in traditional information and communications technology (ICT) networks. SCADA communications are deterministic, and their operation model is often cyclical. Based on this premise, modeling normal behavior by mining specific features gets feasible.",
