  abstract = {In the same manner that Online Social Networks (OSN) usage 
      increases, non-legitimate campaigns over these types of web services are 
      growing. This is the reason why significant number of users are affected by 
      social spam every day and therefore, their privacy is threatened. To deal 
      with this issue in this study we focus on mood analysis, among all 
      content-based analysis techniques. We demonstrate that using this technique 
      social spam filtering results are improved. First, the best spam filtering 
      classifiers are identified using a labeled dataset consisting of Youtube 
      comments, including spam. Then, a new dataset is created adding the mood 
      feature to each comment, and the best classifiers are applied to it. A 
      comparison between obtained results with and without mood information shows 
      that this feature can help to improve social spam filtering results: the 
      best accuracy is improved in two different datasets, and the number of 
      false positives is reduced 13.76{\%} and 11.41{\%} on average. Moreover, 
      the results are validated carrying out the same experiment but using a 
      different dataset.},
