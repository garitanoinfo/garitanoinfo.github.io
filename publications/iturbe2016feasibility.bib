  abstract = {Process Control Systems (PCSs) are the operating core of Critical
  	Infrastructures (CIs). As such, anomaly detection has been an active
  	research field to ensure CI normal operation. Previous approaches
  	have leveraged network level data for anomaly detection, or have
  	disregarded the existence of process disturbances, thus opening the
  	possibility of mislabelling disturbances as attacks and vice versa.
  	In this paper we present an anomaly detection and diagnostic system
  	based on Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC), that aims
  	to distinguish between attacks and disturbances. For this end, we
  	expand traditional MSPC to monitor process level and controller level
  	data. We evaluate our approach using the Tennessee-Eastman process.
  	Results show that our approach can be used to distinguish disturbances
  	from intrusions to a certain extent and we conclude that the proposed
  	approach can be extended with other sources of data for improving
  	results.},
