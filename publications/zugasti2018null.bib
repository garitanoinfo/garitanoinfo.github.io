  abstract = {Industrial environments have vastly changed since
  the conception of initial primitive and isolated networks. The
  current full interconnection paradigm, where connectivity between different 
  devices and the Internet has become a business
  necessity, has driven device interconnectivity towards building
  the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), enabling added value
  services such as supply chain optimization or improved process
  control. However, whereas interconnectivity has increased, IIoT
  security practices has not evolved at the same pace, due partly
  to inherited security practices from when industrial networks
  where not connected and the existence of basic hardware with
  no security functionalities. In this work, we present an Anomaly
  Detection System for industrial environments that monitors
  physical quantities to detect intrusions. It is based in the null
  space detection, which is at the same time, based on Stochastic
  Subspace Identification (SSI). The approach is validated using
  the Tennessee-Eastman chemical process.}
