<p>He earned his MSc in Telecommunication Engineering and PhD from <a href="https://www.mondragon.edu/en" target="_blank" title="Mondragon Unibertsitatea">Mondragon Unibertsitatea</a>. His doctoral thesis, <a href="https://ebiltegia.mondragon.edu/xmlui/handle/20.500.11984/1712?locale-attribute=en" target="_blank" title="Behavioral Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems"><i>Behavioral Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems</i></a>, focused on developing new approaches for detecting anomalies in Industrial Control Systems. To conduct this research, data was collected from Industrial Control Systems through collaboration with several institutions. The research was performed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100316060920/http://ipsc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank" title="Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen (IPSC)">Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen (IPSC)</a>, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/" target="_blank" title="Joint Research Centre (JRC)">Joint Research Centre (JRC)</a> of the European Commission, and <a href="https://www.mondragon.edu/en" target="_blank" title="Mondragon Unibertsitatea">Mondragon Unibertsitatea</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to joining <a href="https://www.mondragon.edu/en" target="_blank" title="Mondragon Unibertsitatea">Mondragon Unibertsitatea</a> in 2015, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIK" target="_blank" title="Universitetssenteret p친 Kjeller (UNIK)">Universitetssenteret p친 Kjeller (UNIK)</a>, where he focused on measurable Security, Privacy, and Dependability (SPD), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Internet of Things (IoT). Afterwards, he was awarded a grant from the <a href="https://www.incibe.es/en/" target="_blank" title="INCIBE">National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE)</a> for a second postdoctoral position, during which he conducted research on various topics within the current research group.</p>

<p>Since 2014, he has been involved with the <a href="http://www.basicinternet.org/" target="_blank" title="Basic Internet Foundation">Basic Internet Foundation</a>, where he has contributed to the development of network and IT system management functions, as well as providing technological consulting services.</p>

<p>Currently, he is involved in several research projects supported by public funding, in addition to his teaching work. His research contributions have expanded to include conference presentations, academic journal publications, and book chapters.</p>
